        I try to keep this website as privacy friendly as possible.
        I am using a self-hosted version of <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">umami</a> for the only purpose of knowing how many people are visiting this website.

      <p>
        If you came to this page through a Google Ad, I'm also including Google Tag Manager to be able to track conversions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you enable &quot;Do Not Track&quot; in your browser I won&apos;t track you</b>.
        Also AdBlockers will work for blocking the tracking. I&apos;d recomment <i>uBlock Origin</i> for that.
