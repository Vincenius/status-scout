# StatusScout

> **StatusScout** is your all-in-one website health and status monitoring tool. It lets you quickly check your site's uptime, performance, SEO, accessibility, security headers, SSL certificate, presence of sensitive files, broken links, and more â€” all from one interface.

Things to remember when using StatusScout:

- It's open-source (see source and how it works on GitHub).
- It combines Lighthouse-based checks (for SEO, performance, a11y) plus custom scans (security headers, broken links, sensitive files).
- Plans for future enhancements include DNS checks, monitoring, and alerting capabilities.
- The frontend is built with React + Vite + Mantine UI; the backend uses Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis for background job queuing.
- When you enter a URL, various checks are triggered as background jobs; broken link checks are currently limited to the first 200 links.
